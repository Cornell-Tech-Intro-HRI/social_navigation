INFO 5356-030: Introduction to Human-Robot Interaction 

Lab 5 - Social Navigation

In this lab, you will learn how to build a map of the environment, send navigation waypoints to the robot. You will use localization and mapping to enable the robot to locate objects in the environment as it navigates. The Turtlebot 4 platform comes equipped with the ROS2 Navigation Stack which is software that enables robots to autonomously navigate in an environment (see [Tutorial](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/tutorials/generate_map.html) reference).  

The learning outcomes of Lab 5 are:
- [Task 1 - Create a Social Navigation Node](#Task-1-Create-a-Social-Navigation-Node) 
- [Task 2 - Create a map](#Task_2_Create_a_map) 
- [Task 3 - Send navigation waypoints to the robot](#Task_3_Send_navigation_waypoints_to_the_robot) 

## Prerequisite

Download Social Navigation package
``` 
cd ~/<ros_workspace>/src/
git clone https://github.com/Cornell-Tech-Intro-HRI/social_navigation.git 
```

## Task 1 - Create a Social Navigation Node

The goal of this task is to set up a ROS2 workspace with the social_navigation package.

### Step 1: Run the Social Navigation package and node

``` 
cd ~/<ros_workspace>/src/
bash social_navigation_node.sh
```

### Step 2: Customize package.xml Update the following fields

- Maintainer - Enter group member names
- Maintainer Email - Email one email address from the student group members
- Description - Add a brief description of the proxemic detector package
- Under ‚Äò<test_depend>‚Äô add these lines: 

```
<depend>rclpy</depend>
<depend>geometry_msgs</depend>
<depend>std_msgs</depend>
```

### Step 3: Run the social_navigation node. 

Open a terminal and run:
```
cd ~/<ros_workspace>/ 
bash run_run_social_navigation.sh
```

## Task 2 - Create a map

This task involves generating a map of the robot‚Äôs environment so that it can avoid colliding into obstacles as it navigates an environment using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). SLAM scans the environment using the Lidar sensor to create a 2D occupancy grid that records the locations of objects.

### Step 1: Launch RPLIDAR nodes. Open a terminal and run:

```
ros2 launch turtlebot4_bringup oakd.launch.py 
```

### Step 2: Launch SLAM

SLAM relies on RPLIDAR nodes to map an environment as a 2D occupancy grid. Launch the RPLIDAR and description nodes and run SLAM on the robot. Open a terminal and run:
```
ros2 launch turtlebot4_navigation slam_sync.launch.py
```

### Step 3: Launch RVIZ

Visualize the 2D map in RVIZ using the view_robot launch file. Open a terminal and run:
```
ros2 launch turtlebot4_viz view_robot.launch.py
```

### Step 4: Scan the room using RPLIDAR. 

Drive the robot around the environment to scan it with the Lidar sensor to generate a 2D occupancy grid. The robot can be operated using teleop or driving the robot with the remote controller. Open a terminal and run:

Teleop:
```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install ros-galactic-teleop-twist-keyboard
source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash 
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
<p align="center"> 
<img src="images/teleop.png" width=460></img> 
</p>

Remote Controller:
```
ros2 launch turtlebot4_bringup joy_teleop.launch.py
```

### Step 5: Save the map. 

After building the map, save it to your ROS workspace. Open a terminal, navigate to your ROS workspace, and save the map (replace 'map_name' with your desired filename e.g., ‚Äòtata_251‚Äô). Lastly, confirm that the map has been saved in the last step below by confirming your map is in the current directory. Open a terminal and run:

```
cd ~<ros_workspace>/
ros2 service call /slam_toolbox/save_map slam_toolbox/srv/SaveMap "name: data: 'map_name'"
ls
```

### Step 5: View the map. 

Save the map generates 'map_name.pgm‚Äô and 'map_name.yaml' files. Open the .pgm file to confirm that your map looks correct.

## Task 3 - Send navigation waypoints to the robot

The goal of this task is to design a delivery robot that navigates from the following positions:
- Docking station
- Waypoint 1
- Waypoint 2
- Docking station

### Step 1: Load the new map into ROS2 Navigation Stack. 

Open a terminal and run this command using your .yaml file from Task 1. Open a terminal and run:
```
ros2 launch turtlebot4_navigation nav_bringup.launch.py slam:=off localization:=true map:=tata_251.yaml
```

### Step 2: Launch RViz to collect poses.

Launch RViz to collect (x, y) waypoints for the robot to navigate through. Open a terminal and run:
```
ros2 launch turtlebot4_viz view_robot.launch.py
```

### Step 3: Collect 2D waypoints. 

Collect 2D waypoints for the tutlebot to navigate through using the 2D Pose Estimate tool. Open a terminal and echo the /clicked_point topic:
```
ros2 topic echo /clicked_point
```
Click on the ‚ÄòPublish Point‚Äô button and then click on the desired waypoint on the map and record the x and y coordinates for 2 waypoints.

### Step 4: Set robot waypoints.

Enter the two (x,y) waypoints you recorded in Task 1 on lines [X,Y] of social_navigation_node.py file.
